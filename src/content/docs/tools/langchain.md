> LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

- Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source building blocks and components.
  Hit the ground running using third-party integrations and Templates.-
- Productionization: Use `LangSmith` to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains,
  so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
- Deployment: Turn any chain into an API with `LangServe`.
