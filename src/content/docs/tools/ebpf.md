## [What is eBPF?](https://ebpf.io/what-is-ebpf/#what-is-ebpf)

eBPF is a revolutionary technology with origins in the Linux kernel that can run sandboxed programs in a privileged context, such as the operating system kernel.

It is used to safely and efficiently **extend the capabilities of the kernel** without requiring to change kernel source code or load kernel modules.
