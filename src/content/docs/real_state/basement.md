title: Basement

There are several types of basements available. Most of them are pretty self-explanatory,
but if you've never had a basement before, you'll want to be clear on what you're getting.

## Partial Basement

A partial basement doesn't extend to the full footprint of the house.
In other words, the square footage of the partial basement will be
smaller than the square footage of the home's main floor.
This usually happens when there's been a **home addition added onto the
house at a later date**, instead of at the time the home was constructed.

## Full Basement

Of all the types of basements, a full basement is the most common.
The ceiling is typically high enough for an average-height person to stand up straight,
but might be lower than a typical above-ground ceiling like you would find in the rest of the house.
