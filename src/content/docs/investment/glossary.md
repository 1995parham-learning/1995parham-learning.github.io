## Bid Price/Ask Price

The term **bid** refers to the highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of shares of a stock at any given time.
The term **ask** refers to the lowest price at which a seller will sell the stock.

The bid price will almost _always be lower_ than the ask or offer, price.
The difference between the bid price and the ask price is called the **spread**.
