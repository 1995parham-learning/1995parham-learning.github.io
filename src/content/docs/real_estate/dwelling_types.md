## Introduction

Where someone lives. **Houses, apartments, and condos** are all dwellings.

The biggest difference between a condo and an apartment is ownership.
An [apartment](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/what-is-an-apartment/)
is defined as a residence that is rented, often as part of a larger residential building.
A [condo](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/what-is-a-condo/) can be similar in structure
to an apartment — usually a unit within a larger residential building — but condos are owned instead of rented.
The [property taxes](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/property-taxes/)
of a condo are paid by the owner; property taxes for an apartment are paid by landlords, not renters.

### Apartment / Condo

A self-contained [housing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_unit)
(a type of residential [real estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate))
that occupies part of a building, generally on a single story.

### Residential

House (Detached) / Townhouse (End Row, In Row) / Semi-Detached / Duplex

#### Single-detached house (Code 1)

A single dwelling not attached to any other dwelling or structure (except its own garage or shed).
A single-detached house has open space on all sides, and has no dwellings either above or below it.
