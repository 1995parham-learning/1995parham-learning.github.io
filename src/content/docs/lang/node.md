## `npm upgrade`

I really love to upgrade the node packages, but `npm update` only update the packages
using the rules in the `package.json` but how I can change the versions in the `packages.json`?

```bash
npx npm-check-updates
```

[npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) changes the `packages.json`
and upgrades packages into their latest release.
