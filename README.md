# Parham's Notes

## Introduction

These are the notes that I write during reading books, blog posts and writing codes.

## Quartz

[Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) is a set of tools that helps you publish your digital garden
and notes as a website for free. Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.
