Bloom filters are a **probabilistic data structure** that _checks for presence of an element in a set_.

Instead of storing all the elements in the set, Bloom Filters store only the **elements' hashed representation**,
thus sacrificing some precision. The trade-off is that Bloom Filters are very _space-efficient_ and _fast_.
