## Big bang Deployment

**Big bang deployment** when you deploy by downtime.

## Canary Deployment

A **canary deployment** is a progressive rollout of an application that splits traffic between an
already-deployed version and a new version, rolling it out to a subset of users before rolling out fully.

## Blue–Green Deployments

In **blue–green deployments**, two servers are maintained: a “blue” server and a “green” server.
The blue version is the live version and green one is the backup one. At any given time, only one server
is handling requests (e.g., being pointed to by the DNS).
