title: Hypothesis Testing
---
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to assess whether a claim (hypothesis) about a population is
likely true based on evidence from a sample.

It involves formulating two opposing hypotheses: the null hypothesis (`H0`), which represents the default assumption
of no difference or effect, and the alternative hypothesis (`Ha`), which proposes the opposite.
We collect data from a sample of the population and use statistical calculations to determine the
_probability of observing such data if the null hypothesis were true_.
This probability is called the _p-value_. If the p-value is very low (typically below 0.05),
we reject the null hypothesis and tentatively support the alternative hypothesis.

It's important to remember that hypothesis testing **doesn't definitively prove anything**,
but rather provides **strong evidence for or against a claim based on the sample data**.
