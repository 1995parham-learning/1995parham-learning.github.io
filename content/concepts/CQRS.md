CQRS stands for **Command Query Responsibility Segregation**, which is a design pattern used in software engineering to separate the responsibilities of handling commands (changing state) from the responsibility of querying data.

    This pattern splits the responsibility of handling commands that change data from handling queries that retrieve data in software systems.
    This separation allows for more flexibility and scalability in managing complex operations. In a system following the CQRS pattern, commands are responsible for modifying the state of the system, while queries are responsible for retrieving data from the system.
