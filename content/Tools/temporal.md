Whether you're writing a complex transaction-based workflow or working with remote APIs, creating reliable applications
is a complex process.
The temporal cluster and a language-specific SDK provide a comprehensive solution to the complexities that arise from
model application development. You can think of Temporal as a sort of "cure-all" for the pains you experience as
a developer when trying to build reliable applications.

Temporal provides **reliability primitives**, such as:

- Seamless and fault-tolerant application state tracking
- Automatic retries
- Timeouts
- Rollbacks due to process failures
