## Drift

### What Is Distribution Drift?

Distribution drift is a change in the _distribution_ of the **data**, the **label** or the **relationship between them**.
Drift happens over time, and can occur either gradually or suddenly.

Common reasons for drift can be **natural changes** in the data, such as shopping habits changing for an online
retailer (for example, during the covid pandemic, online shopping rose significantly and buyer patterns changed),
or **data acquisition and processing issues**, such as camera settings changing accidentally to have lower exposure.
