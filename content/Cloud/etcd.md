> A distributed, reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system

> [!info]
**etcd** is a strongly consistent, distributed key-value store that provides a reliable way to store data that needs to be accessed by a distributed system or cluster of machines. It gracefully handles leader elections during network partitions and can tolerate machine failure, even in the leader node. [Learn more](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/)
