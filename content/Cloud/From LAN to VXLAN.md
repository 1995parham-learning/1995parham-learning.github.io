## What is a LAN?

[**LAN (Local Area Network)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) - [broadly] a computer network that interconnects computers within a **limited area** such as a residence, school, office building, or data center. A LAN is not limited to a single [IP subnetwork](https://labs.iximiuz.com/courses/computer-networking-fundamentals/from-lan-to-vxlan#L3-segment). Like a [Wide area network (WAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network), a LAN can consist of multiple IP networks communicating via routers. The main determinant of a LAN is the locality (i.e. proximity) of the participants, not the L3 topology.

## Whats is a Network Link?

**Network link** - a physical and logical network component used to interconnect [any kind of] nodes in the network. All nodes of a single network link use the same [link-layer protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer).

Examples:

- A group of computers connected to a network switch (Ethernet)
- A set of smartphones connected to a [Wi-Fi access point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point) (non-Ethernet)
- Etc.
