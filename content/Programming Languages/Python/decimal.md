The [`decimal`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#module-decimal) module provides support for fast correctly rounded decimal floating-point arithmetic. It offers several advantages over the [`float`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) datatype:

-   Decimal _is based on a floating-point model which was designed with people in mind, and necessarily has a paramount guiding principle – computers must provide an arithmetic that works in the same way as the arithmetic that people learn at school._ – excerpt from the decimal arithmetic specification.
-   Decimal numbers can be represented exactly. In contrast, numbers like `1.1` and `2.2` do not have exact representations in binary floating point. End users typically would not expect `1.1 + 2.2` to display as `3.3000000000000003` as it does with binary floating point.
-   The exactness carries over into arithmetic. In decimal floating point, `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` is exactly equal to zero. In binary floating point, the result is `5.5511151231257827e-017`. While near to zero, the differences prevent reliable equality testing and differences can accumulate. For this reason, decimal is preferred in **accounting applications** which have strict equality invariants.
