WebSockets are a powerful communication protocol that enables persistent, bidirectional connections between a client (like a web browser) and a server. Unlike the traditional HTTP request-response model where the client initiates each request, WebSockets allow the server to push data to the client without waiting for a request. This makes them ideal for real-time applications where immediate updates are crucial.

Think of live chat applications, online multiplayer games, stock tickers, or collaborative editing tools â€“ these all benefit significantly from the low-latency, real-time capabilities of WebSockets. In essence, WebSockets provide a persistent connection, allowing for a continuous flow of information in both directions, making them a fundamental technology for modern interactive web experiences.
