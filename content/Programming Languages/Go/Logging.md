Golang developers commonly create two primary types of applications. For command-line tools, leveraging [pterm](https://pterm.sh) offers a richer user experience with formatted logs and information, surpassing simple print statements. When building server-side applications, [zap](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) is a superior choice, featuring structured logging. This allows for concurrent log output to both the console and syslog, which is crucial for operational monitoring. Notably, structured logging greatly enhances the speed and accuracy of log searches within log aggregation platforms.
