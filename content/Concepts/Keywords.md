There are some concepts in the software engineering that are useful to know. I can use them to describe my experiences better and even use them to do things in a better way.

-   The ‘E’, ‘S’, ‘G’ in **ESG** data stands for, “Environmental, Social, and Governance” – otherwise known as the three key components that companies will use to determine the environmental efficacy and sustainability of their cooperation.
-   A full-time equivalent, sometimes abbreviated as **FTE**, is a unit to measure employed persons or students in a way that makes them comparable, although they may work or study a different number of hours per week.
-   **Parking lot** is a project management technique used to keep a team meeting on track. If a group conversation is in danger of veering off-topic, you could put that particular topic in the hypothetical parking lot. That way, you are ‘parking’ it for later so your team can focus on the more pressing issues.
-   A **dress rehearsal** is a full-scale rehearsal where actors and musicians perform every detail of a performance.
