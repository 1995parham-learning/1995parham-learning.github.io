_Security Assertion Markup Language, or SAML_, is a standardized way to tell external applications and services that a user is who they say they are. SAML makes single sign-on (SSO) technology possible by providing a way to authenticate a user once and then communicate that authentication to multiple applications. The most current version of SAML is SAML 2.0.
