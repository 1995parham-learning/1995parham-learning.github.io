_Security Assertion Markup Language, or SAML_, is a standardized way to tell external applications and services that a user is who they say they are. ==SAML makes single sign-on (SSO) technology possible by providing a way to authenticate a user once and then communicate that authentication to multiple applications==. The most current version of SAML is SAML 2.0.

In computing and networking, one of the major challenges is getting systems and devices built by different vendors for different purposes to work together. This is called "interoperability": the ability for different machines to interact with each other, despite their differing technical specifications. SAML is an interoperable standard â€” it is a widely accepted way to communicate a user's identity to cloud service providers.
