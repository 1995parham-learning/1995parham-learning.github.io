## Background

Stage Analysis uses **chart patterns** to describe **four distinct stages** that a particular trade can be in.  The stage, and transitions between stages, have specific guidelines for whether a trader should buy, sell, or hold the trade.  This creates a simple strategy to follow when trading the market.  Stage Analysis helps traders identify and stay invested in long term trends in the market.
