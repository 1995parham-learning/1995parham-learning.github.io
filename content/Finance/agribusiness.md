Agribusiness encompasses the economic sectors for farming and farming-related commerce.
It involves all the steps for getting agricultural goods to the market,
including _production_, _processing_, and _distribution_.
The industry is a traditional part of any economy, especially for countries with arable land and
excess agricultural products for export.

## Agricultural Credit

The term agricultural credit refers to one of several credit vehicles used to finance agricultural transactions.
These vehicles include loans, notes, bills of exchange, and banker's acceptances.

Agricultural credit, which is also commonly referred to as agricultural finance, is an important component of
the economy, especially in countries with arable land since agricultural products can be exported.

**Short-term credit** finances operating expenses,
**intermediate-term credit** is used for farm machinery,
and **long-term credit** is used for real estate financing.
