## Bid Price/Ask Price

The term **bid** refers to the highest price a buyer will pay to buy a specified number of shares of a stock at any given time. The term **ask** refers to the lowest price at which a seller will sell the stock.

The bid price will almost _always be lower_ than the ask or offer, price. The difference between the bid price and the ask price is called the **spread**.

## Primary Market

A primary market is a source of new securities. Often on an exchange, it's where companies, governments, and other groups go to obtain financing through debt-based or equity-based securities.

In the primary market, new stocks and bonds are sold to the public **for the first time**.

In a primary market, investors are able to purchase securities _directly from the issuer_.

## Secondary Market

The secondary market is where investors buy and sell securities. Trades take place on the secondary market _between other investors and traders rather than from the companies that issue the securities_.

## Security

Property or goods that you promise to give to someone if you cannot pay what you owe them.
