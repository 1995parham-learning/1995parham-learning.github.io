## What Is a Meme Coin?

A meme coin is a cryptocurrency named after characters, individuals, animals, artwork, or anything else in an attempt to be humorous, light-hearted, and attract a user base by _promising a fun community_.

- Meme coins are a type of cryptocurrency that relies on humor and the promise of a fun community to attract users.
- Examples of meme coins include blockchain-based coins and tokens such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.
