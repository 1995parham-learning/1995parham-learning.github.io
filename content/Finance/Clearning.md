In banking and finance, clearing refers to _all activities from the time a commitment is made for a transaction until it is settled_. This process turns the promise of payment into the actual movement of money from one account to another. Clearing houses were formed to facilitate such transactions among banks.

The United States clearing system, known as **CHIPS**, is the largest clearing system in the world.
