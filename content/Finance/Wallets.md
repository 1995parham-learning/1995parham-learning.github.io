> Picture a crypto wallet as your personal interface to the digital currency world â€“ a tool that manages your private and public keys, tracks your assets, and enables digital transactions.

Crypto wallets can be categorized into two main types:

- Hot
- Cold

Think of hot wallets as your conventional wallet, always connected to the internet, providing quick and easy access to your assets. Contrastingly, cold wallets serve as a kind of secure vault, preserving your assets offline on a hardware device or even a piece of paper for utmost security.
