## What Is a Market Maker?

The term "market maker" refers to a _firm_ or individual who actively quotes both sides of a market in a particular security by providing bids and offers (known as asks) along with the market size of each. In fact, they are obligated to engage in such trading activity.1

Market makers provide liquidity and depth to markets and profit from the difference in the bid-ask spread. They may also trade for their own accounts. Such trades are known as principal trades.
