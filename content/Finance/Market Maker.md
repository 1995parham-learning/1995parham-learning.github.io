## What Is a Market Maker?

The term "market maker" refers to a _firm_ or _individual_ who actively quotes both sides of a market in a particular security by providing bids and offers (known as asks) along with the market size of each. In fact, they are obligated to engage in such trading activity.

Market makers provide liquidity and depth to markets and profit from the difference in the bid-ask spread. They may also trade for their own accounts. Such trades are known as principal trades.

## Understanding Market Makers

Many market makers are brokerage houses that provide trading services for investors. They make markets in an effort to keep financial markets liquid.

A market maker can also be an individual trader, who is commonly known as a local. The vast majority of such market makers work on behalf of large institutions due to the lot sizes needed to facilitate the volume of purchases and sales.

## How They Work

Each market maker displays buy and sell quotations (two-sided markets) for a guaranteed number of shares. Once the market maker receives an order from a buyer, they immediately sell their position of shares from their own inventory. This allows them to complete the order.

A market maker must commit to continuously quoting prices at which it will buy (or [bid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid.asp) for) and sell (or [ask](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp) for) securities.2

Market makers must also quote the volume in which they're willing to trade along with the frequency of time they will quote at the [best bid](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bestbid.asp) and best offer prices.

Market makers must stick to these parameters at all times, no matter what their market outlook. When markets become erratic or [volatile](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volatility.asp), market makers must remain disciplined in order to continue facilitating smooth transactions.
