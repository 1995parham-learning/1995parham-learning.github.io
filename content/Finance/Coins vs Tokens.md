**Coins** are the native currencies of specific blockchains. For example, BTC is the native coin of the Bitcoin network.

On the other hand, **tokens** are currencies (or digital assets) supported by a specific blockchain, rather than powering their own.

> Coins refer to any cryptocurrency that has a standalone, independent blockchain.

Put simply, if the cryptocurrency runs on its own blockchain, then it is a coin. This native coin is what you use for paying transaction fees and participating in the network. This native coin is what network participants receive in return for keeping that network secure. ==Coins provide the necessary basis of a blockchain networkâ€™s security model==.
