When it comes to cryptocurrency trading, itâ€™s essential to understand the different **order types** that are available to traders. Sometimes, the difference between a successful trade and a missed opportunity comes down to choosing the right order type.

Most cryptocurrency exchanges allow traders to choose between Market, Limit, and Stop-Limit Orders. These common order types provide traders with basic control over their trades.

## Market Orders

Market Orders are the most straightforward order type, allowing traders to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at the **current market price**. By executing instantly when placed, Market Orders are great tools for traders looking to seize the moment.

> However, by prioritizing speed over price, the actual price of execution for a Market Order may differ from the displayed market price, especially in highly volatile markets.

## Limit Orders

Limit Orders allow traders to **set specific price levels** at which they want to buy or sell a cryptocurrency. Unlike Market Orders, which trigger instantly when placed and prioritize speed of execution over price, limit orders will only trigger if the market price reaches or exceeds your specified price.
