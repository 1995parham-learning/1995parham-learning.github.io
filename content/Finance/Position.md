## What Is a Position?

A position is the amount of a security, asset, or property that is **owned** (or sold short) by some individual or other entity. A trader or investor takes a position when they make a purchase through a buy order, signaling bullish intent; or if they sell short securities, with bearish intent.

Opening a new position is ultimately followed at some point in the future by **exiting** or **closing the position**.

## Understanding Positions 

Positions come in two main types.
- Long positions are most common and involve owning a security or contract. Long positions gain when there is an increase in price and lose when there is a decrease.
