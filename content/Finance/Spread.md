**Crypto spread** is defined as the gap between the highest price someone is willing to pay and the lowest price someone is willing to sell a cryptocurrency asset.

These two defining points are often referred to as the bid and ask price.

- **Ask**. The lowest price someone is willing to sell
- **Bid**. The highest price someone is willing to pay
