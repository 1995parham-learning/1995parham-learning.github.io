## What Are Matching Orders?

Matching orders is the process by which a securities exchange pairs one or more unsolicited buy orders to one or more sell orders to make trades. This can be contrasted with requests for a quote (RFQ) in a security to proceed with a trade.

If one investor wants to buy a quantity of stock and another wants to sell the same quantity at the same price, their orders match, and a transaction is effected. The work of pairing these orders is the process of order matching whereby exchanges identify buy orders, or _bids_, with corresponding sell orders, or _asks_, to execute them.
