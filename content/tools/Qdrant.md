## Introduction

Vector databases are a relatively new way for interacting with abstract data representations derived from opaque machine learning models such as deep learning architectures. These representations are often called _vectors_ or _embeddings_, and they are a compressed version of the data used to train a machine learning model to accomplish a task like sentiment analysis, speech recognition, object detection, and many others.

These new databases shine in many applications like [semantic search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_search) and [recommendation systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system), and here, weâ€™ll learn about one of the most popular and fastest growing vector databases in the market, [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant).
