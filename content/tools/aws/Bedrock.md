Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing **foundation models (FMs)** from leading AI companies like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Luma (coming soon), Meta, Mistral AI, poolside (coming soon), Stability AI, and Amazon through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI.

In a few quick steps, Amazon Bedrock lets you go from generic models to ones that are specialized and customized for your business and use case.Â To adapt an FM for a specific task, you can use a technique called **fine-tuning**.

**Continued training** aims to broaden or deepen a model's knowledge and capabilities by training it further on additional data, while **fine-tuning** specifically adapts a pre-trained model to a particular task or domain with _less data_ and _fewer resources_.
