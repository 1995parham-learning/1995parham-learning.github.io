In just the last few decades, the world of TV advertising has grown and evolved at an unprecedented rate. Marketers are no longer limited to pushing their brands and products on linear television channels via blanket ads. All sorts of options are available for targeting consumers and increasing brand awareness these days, and one of the most powerful is addressable TV.

## What Is Addressable TV?

Addressable TV advertising allows brands to target specific households of viewers with tailored messages, even if they are watching the same programming, typically through traditional cable or satellite TV systems.

### How Addressable TV Advertising Works

Addressable TV advertising works by leveraging data analytics and ad delivery software to deliver targeted ads to specific households or individuals. Unlike traditional TV ads, which broadcast the same content to all viewers watching a particular program, addressable TV allows you to _segment audiences_ based on various factors, such as their behavior, geographical location, and demographics.0
