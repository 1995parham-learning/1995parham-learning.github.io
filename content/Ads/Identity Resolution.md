Brands know interactions that feel personal and relevant to customers are key to driving conversions in our oversaturated digital environment. However, as signal loss continues, brands face significant challenges in maintaining effective reach, targeting, and measurement in their marketing efforts, and now is the time to get your first-party data strategies in order.

Without the signals third-party cookies send, it’s harder for companies to understand how customers interact with their brands across the digital ecosystem and owned channels. Specifically, charting customer journeys beyond the original touch point — for example, an email nurture campaign — becomes more difficult. As time goes on, the signal grows faint, meaning brands urgently need to adopt more robust mechanisms for reaching and engaging customers.

Enter identity resolution.

Identity resolution is the ability to accurately resolve consumer data from a variety of sources to a household or an individual in a privacy-centric manner. Identity should be the foundation of everything you do across your enterprise. As third-party signals fade, a robust identity strategy enables precise and personalized customer interactions, ensuring your marketing efforts build brand loyalty and drive conversions.
