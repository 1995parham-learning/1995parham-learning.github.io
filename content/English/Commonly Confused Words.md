## House vs. Home: What's the Difference?

The terms house and home are often used interchangeably, but they evoke different meanings. _A house refers to a physical structure made of walls, a roof, and a foundation that provides shelter_. It is tangible and focuses on the physical aspects of a building. In contrast, a _home is where one creates personal memories and feels a sense of belonging_. It represents comfort, security, and emotional warmth. It's not solely about the physical space but about the feelings and relationships within.
